#### Project title

Sensorem: making music with sensors



#### What have you done for your project so far?

C: I managed to make a breadboard project that uses the ultrasonic sensor to do two things: send data to max based on the distance to the sensor and a light system that activates depending on where you are in relation to the total range (0-200)

Max: Three different scales that can be activated to output midi data. 

Box: I already have the design of my box. It will be a dodecahedral with knobs, sensor, and maybe a couple of piezo pieces.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not combined firmata to the script that I'm currently working on. Mainly because there's certain serial considerations that I still don't fully understand. 

I have not started the actual hardware (box and soldering). I intend to do that during the weekend. Still considering if it should be made out of wood or plastic.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My ultrasonic sensor doesn't provide the range that I'm specifying in my code. It stays in the lower values... I changed the sensor and cables and it improved but it still doesn't work as I need it to work. My lights are also not too responsive (it might be because they are a little bit old).

### Sensorem: 
*Sensorem* is a music making tool that acts as a MIDI instrument and controller. This piece of technology is based on two essential components: ultrasonic sensor (that allows the user to input the notes into Max) and a analog controller (that communicates with Ableton Live). Its design makes it a very easy-to-use instrument that sounds in any way that the user desires.

### Build and Run Commands:


[Install Arduino IDE ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

[Install Ableton Live ](https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/)

[Install Connection Kit on Ableton Live ](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/connection-kit/)

### Hardware:

1. Arduino Uno (or equivalent)
2. Arduino Mega (or equivalent)
3. Ultrasonic Sensor
4. LEDs
5. Potentiometers
6. Wires
7. Breadboard

###How to Setup:

1. [Arduino # 1: Uses Firmata to control Ableton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tME9uVHjnRg)
2. [Ultrasonic Sensor](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/abdularbi17/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04-with-arduino-tutorial-327ff6)


To build ultrasonicSensor.ino and StandardFirmata.ino:

	 Verify and Upload using Arduino IDE
	
	 

To activate SerialCommunication.maxpat:

	 print serial object to obtain port of the Ultrasonic Sensor Arduino
	 Change it to that port and data should be recieved

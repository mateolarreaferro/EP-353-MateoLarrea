### Purpose:
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to work with arrays, strings, and command line arguments. 
### Description:
**Problem Set 6.1** consisted in asking the user for input of MIDI data to then create a function that contrains the value to a range of 0-127. This is achieved by using pointers  **Problem Set 6.2** consisted in using the user's input to initialize an array of size 8. This excercise was focused in passing pointers into functions and out. Finally, **Problem Set 6.3** consisted in inputing a string and then reverse the order of its elements into a new string using pointer arithmetic. 



### Build and Run Commands:
To build ProblemSet6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, use:

	 clang ProblemSet6.1.c -o ProblemSet6.1
	 clang ProblemSet6.2.c -o ProblemSet6.2
	 clang ProblemSet5.6.c -o ProblemSet6.3
	 

To run the compiled ProblemSet6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 programs, use: 

	 ./ProblemSet6.1
	 ./ProblemSet6.2
	 ./ProblemSet6.3

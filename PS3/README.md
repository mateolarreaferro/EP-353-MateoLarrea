### Files Included:
1. README.md
2. ProblemSet3.1.c
3. ProblemSet3.2.c
4. ProblemSet3.3.c

### Purpose:
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use operators and control flow. This includes: decision making (if-then statements, loops, switch statement, and more)

### Description:
**Problem Set 3.1** consisted in using the decibel to amplitude formula to write a program that outuputs the amplitude of a given dB value. Additionally, this problem required the use of a char variable to store the value of loudness (ASCII table was required). 
**Problem Set 3.2** consisted in using the Switch statement to assign numbers to a major scale. The program then was able to ouput the correct number (based on C = 1 relation) when given a note of the scale.
Finally, **Problem Set 3.3** consisted in creating a for loop of a chromatic scale to then output its 12 notes in order. 



### Build and Run Commands:
To build ProblemSet3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, use:

	 clang ProblemSet3.1.c -o ProblemSet3.1
	 clang ProblemSet3.2.c -o ProblemSet3.2
	 clang ProblemSet3.3.c -o ProblemSet3.3
	 

To run the compiled ProblemSet3.1 program, use: 

	 ./ProblemSet3.1
	 ./ProblemSet3.2
	 ./ProblemSet3.3

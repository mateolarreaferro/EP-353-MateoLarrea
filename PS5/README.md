2. ProblemSet5.1.c
3. ProblemSet5.2.c
4. ProblemSet5.3.c

### Purpose:
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to work with arrays, strings, and command line arguments. 
### Description:
**Problem Set 5.1** consisted in reversing the order of an array of integers to then print it. **Problem Set 5.2** consisted in making the user input an string and a character and then determine how many times does that character repeats within the string. Finally, **Problem Set 5.3** making the user input to arguments (string and integer) to then print a tail of chars (the integer value determines the size of the tail). I was unable to finish this problem due to a lack of time organization. However, I'll upload it soon.



### Build and Run Commands:
To build ProblemSet5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, use:

	 clang ProblemSet5.1.c -o ProblemSet5.1
	 clang ProblemSet5.2.c -o ProblemSet5.2
	 clang ProblemSet5.3.c -o ProblemSet5.3
	 

To run the compiled ProblemSet5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 programs, use: 

	 ./ProblemSet5.1
	 ./ProblemSet5.2
	 ./ProblemSet5.3

### Acknowledgement:
I used the information provided in class by my teacher, Akito van Troyer and a Techie Delight article that explained how to reverse arrays.

// Problem8.2: File I/O with libsndfile 2

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>



// Create a file named ProblemSet8.2.c.
// Write a program that reads sine.wav and tri.wav (included in the problem set folder).
// Write out a new wave file called sintri.wav that contains the samples of both sine.wav and tri.wav and alternates between them 5 times (sine, tri, sine, tri, sine, tri, etc.).
// The sintri.wav file should be 10 seconds long after alternatively writing the two waveforms.
// You must use libsndfile for this problem set.

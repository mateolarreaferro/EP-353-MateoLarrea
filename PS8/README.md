### Purpose:
The purpose of this problem set is to experiment with audio files in C. It is focused on using libsndfile to modify certain parameters of the file.
### Description:
**Problem Set 8.1** consisted in using the sine.wav file provided in the folder to create a new one that had a duration of 5 seconds instead of 1. **Problem Set 8.2** consisted in opening sine.wav and tri.wav to create a new file names sintri.wav that mixes both of those files. Finally, **Problem Set 8.3** consisted in reversing sine.wav into a new file named ReverseSN.wav

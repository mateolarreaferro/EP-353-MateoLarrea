## Description

In this class, students will learn to program musical examples and projects using the C programming language. Working initially from the Terminal application, using the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) compiler, and later with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the student will write musical programs that do algorithmic composition, software synthesis, and signal processing. Through musical coding, the student will more deeply understand the underlying algorithms that power all electronic music programs. This software engineering class is the first step toward the design of synthesis and signal processing tools. It will provide a marketable technical skill that is often a prerequisite for industry jobs in sound design, game audio, and graduate programs in computer music and music technology.


## Learning Objectives
Along the way of this course, students will

- learn C Programming Language;
- understand how computers work through programming;
- understand software engineering;
- write computer programs for sound synthesis and signal processing;
- understand how digital audio works at the programming level; and
- be able to read documentations.

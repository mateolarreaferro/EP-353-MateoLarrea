### Files Included:
1. README.md
2. ProblemSet9.1.c
3. ProblemSet9.2.c
4. noise.wav
5. pulse.wav



### Purpose:
The purpose of this problem set is to use trigonometric functions to computer different types of waves. Also, it is about using sndfile to continue exploring its functionality.
### Description:
**Problem Set 9.1** consisted in creating a file named noise.wav based on the random function of stdlib. **Problem Set 9.2** consisted in writing a 10% pulse wave that had a duration of 1 second. This problem required the use of a series of harmonics to compute the wave.

2. ProblemSet7.1.c
3. ProblemSet7.2.c
4. ProblemSet5.7.c

### Purpose:
The purpose of this problem set is divided in two parts: 1) Work with functions of stdlib.h in order to manage memory in C. 2) Work with advanced data types to make more complex data structures.
### Description:
**Problem Set 7.1** consisted in asking the user to input numbers that then would be averaged. The user could input any amount of numbers from 0 ~ 100. This problem set used malloc and realloc to change the size of the array taking into account the amount of numbers that the user enters. **Problem Set 7.2** consisted in using the user's input to input a string to then copy it into a new one.Finally, **Problem Set 7.3** consisted in asking the user to input values that would then be stored in a structure named Note.


### Build and Run Commands:
To build ProblemSet7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, use:

	 clang ProblemSet7.1.c -o ProblemSet7.1
	 clang ProblemSet7.2.c -o ProblemSet7.2
	 clang ProblemSet5.7.c -o ProblemSet7.3
	 

To run the compiled ProblemSet7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 programs, use: 

	 ./ProblemSet7.1
	 ./ProblemSet7.2
	 ./ProblemSet7.3
